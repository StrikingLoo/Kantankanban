# Kantankanban ðŸ“Œ

A Kantan CLI tool. Create boards, add cards to them or remove them. 

Built in Python using Typer, it stores cards as JSON data, trivially exportable and usable in other platforms if desired.

## How to Use ðŸš€

ðŸŒ± Create a new board:

`python -m kantankanban init -n $BOARD_NAME`

ðŸ”Ž See all available boards:

`python -m kantankanban list -n boards`

ðŸ““ List all cards in a board:

`python -m kantankanban list -n $BOARD_NAME` (Yes, the board list is just another meta-board!)

Add `-d 1` to see cards' creation dates. ðŸ—“

ðŸŒ· Add a new card to a board:

`python -m kantankanban add 'Card Title' -n $BOARD_NAME`

ðŸ’€ Remove a card from a board:

`python -m kantankanban remove $ID -n $BOARD_NAME` (Get the ID by listing the cards. IDs are mutable)

## Future Updates

Will add soon:

- Tag functionality (including tag-based search)
- `mv` command to transfer a card from one board to another
- Anything else I can think of, or any user suggests

### Relevant commands

Activate environment: 

`source venv/bin/activate`

Run tests:
`python -m pytest tests`
